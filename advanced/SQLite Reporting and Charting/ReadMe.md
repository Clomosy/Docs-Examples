## Features:
- SQLite Database: Stores sales charts, customer analytics, and regional distribution data.

- Data Insertion: Allows insertion of data into the SQLite database, including sales, customer groups, and regional data.

- Data Visualization: Displays the stored data in various chart types (Pie, Bar, Line) using Clomosy charts.

- Dynamic Chart Generation: Automatically generates charts based on the data retrieved from the database.
