Retrieving Data from SQLite Database and Displaying it in ListView

Description
This project presents an application example that works with an SQLite database. The application loads product information (code, name, price) from the database into a list view and displays this data dynamically. A database connection is established, a table is created if it does not exist, and sample products are added. This project focuses on dynamic user interactions such as retrieving data from the database, listing it, and visualizing the information.

Usage
* The project is saved and run after being pasted into the "Main Code" screen.
* The application contains a list of data retrieved from the database.
* To search within the list, the desired data should be typed into the search box located at the top.
