SQLite Database - Searching via Barcode Scanning from the List

Description
This project presents an application example that works with an SQLite database and displays a dynamic list. The application retrieves product information (code, name, price) from the database and presents it in a list view. Additionally, users can search the list using a search box, and a button for barcode scanning is provided. This button allows users to search using a barcode reader. The project demonstrates database operations, search functionality, and user interactions together.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and run.
* The application contains a list populated with data retrieved from the database.
* To search the list, the desired value must be entered into the search box located at the top.
* When the barcode scanning button is clicked, the camera opens, the barcode is scanned, and a search is performed accordingly.
