Listing Data with SQLite Database

Description
This project presents an application example that works with an SQLite database. The application creates a database table containing product information (code, name, price) and generates a list view from this data. By clicking the "More" button for each product, the product name is displayed. The database connection is established, the table is created if it doesn't exist, and sample products are added. This project focuses on database operations, data retrieval, and listing, along with dynamic user interactions.

Usage
* After pasting the code into the "Main Code" screen, save and run the application.
* The application contains a list of data retrieved from the database.
* When the "More" buttons on the left side of the list items are clicked, the product name of the selected item is displayed.
