Accessing the Phone Book

Description
This project aims to develop an application that lists the contacts from a mobile device's address book. The user can view the contacts by clicking a visually designed button. The listed contacts are displayed in a read-only text area (Memo) on the screen. The project utilizes the device management component (TclDeviceManager) to access address book data and manages user click events to provide a dynamic user experience.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and executed.
* When the "List" button in the application is clicked, the names from the address book are written into the TclMemo component.

NOTE: Test the project by running it on a mobile device.
