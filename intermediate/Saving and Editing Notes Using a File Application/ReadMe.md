Saving and Editing Notes Using a File Application

Description
This project aims to develop a "To-Do List" application for users. The application allows users to add notes, view these notes, and clear all notes when needed. Notes are saved to a text file with date and time information and are automatically loaded when the application starts. This project demonstrates the dynamic creation of user interface components, data storage operations, and the management of click events.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and run.
* The desired note information is entered into the field under the "Add Note" heading.
* The add button located just below on the right is clicked, and the data is added to the TclMemo object under the "To Do List" heading.
* If the notebook needs to be completely cleared, the delete button at the bottom of the page is clicked to erase the data.
