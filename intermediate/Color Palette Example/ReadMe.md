Color Palette Example

Description
This project aims to develop an application that provides users with an interactive experience using colors. The application includes panels designed with different colors and labels displaying the color codes. When a user clicks on a panel, a random color is generated, and the panel's background color is updated with the new color. Simultaneously, the corresponding label's text is updated with the new color code. Clicking on the label copies the color code to the clipboard and informs the user about the action. The project demonstrates the dynamic creation of user interface components, the management of click events, and the implementation of random data generation in a practical manner.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and executed.
* Clicking on one of the three different panels in the application triggers a color change.
* The updated color code is displayed in the bottom right corner of each panel. To copy the color code, simply click on it.
