Creating a Horizontally Scrollable List

Description
This project aims to develop an application that designs a horizontally scrollable list to enhance user interaction. The application contains a horizontal scroll box with panels labeled and clickable labels placed at the center of these panels. When a user clicks a label, a custom message assigned to that label is displayed. The project serves as an example to demonstrate how components are dynamically created and how user click events are processed.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and executed.
* When any object in the scrollable list in the application is clicked, the data in the object's clTagStr property is displayed as a message on the screen.
