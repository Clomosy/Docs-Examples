Saving Data to a File in JSON Format

Description
This project allows users to enter their first name, last name, and age through a form, and saves this information in a JSON format to a file. If a record with the same name already exists, it updates the information; otherwise, it adds a new record. Additionally, the saved data is displayed in a memo component. The project aims to demonstrate practical skills in JSON data processing, file reading/writing, and dynamically managing user inputs.

Usage
* The project is pasted into the "Main Code" screen, saved, and run.
* Information should be entered into the fields under the "Name", "Surname", and "Age" labels.
* After entering the information, the "Save" button must be clicked.
* After clicking the button, the data is stored in JSON format in the TclMemo component and also saved to a file.
